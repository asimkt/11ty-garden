title: Master note with all elements
---
The idea of master note is that, it should includes maximum elements we support.

### A sample Heading 3
Now I'm going to add a quote
> "Hello there, how are you?

Now can I refer another post here? Let's try.
1. Link 1 to [[documenting-meeting]]
2. Link 2 to [[secondpost]]

Now you can see Link 1 works well, but not link 2. There some issue with the plugin working. It's looking for title or something. Still needs to figure this out.


## Embed
```markdown
##Embed
Embed is a obsidian mechanism to embed another post.
```

```
...Embed Starting... 
Following content is from another blog called document meeting. 
Maybe we can wrap this with another layout?
```

![[documenting-meeting]]

```
Now Embed is over. This properly rendering.
```


### Images
Now we need to support image as well. Maybe later
