### Basic Principles

1. Have a clear objective for your meeting notes.
2. Keep your notes concise without losing important information.
3. Use tools like [Toggl](https://toggl.com/track/) for time tracking, if needed. Don't spend time making notes ;)
7. Atomise meetings to create lists of information, questions, and action items. Utilise hashtags to represent them, such as `#Question, #ToDo, #Idea, #Decision, #PeopleName, #ProjectName, and #MajorFeature.`
8. Convert recurring meetings into notes and link them. For example: `Project A , 1-1 with Person A`
9. Use [Obsidian Periodic Notes ](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes or Logseq's Daily page for dumping daily notes, instead of one-note-per-meeting

By doing an efficient you can find any notes : For instance: `#Idea Project A , #Question #PersonC` will provide you with any Ideas related to Project A that you want to ask PersonC.

### File Example :

```markdown
File : 10-Feb-2023.md

- 11:00, Meeting on Project A
  - #Info We are not building that feature in this sprint #PersonA
  - #ToDo Update the figma, remove the feature
  - #Question Are we updating the documentation?, to #PersonB
  - #TIL, the date we shared with client is Q3, not Q2
- 13:00, 1:1 with Person A
  - #TODO Prepare next year hiring count and budget
  - #Question Ask #PersonC, if we are hiring remote or to WFO
  - #Idea, add a survey along with Project A
```

### My current method

- I use journal to make live meeting notes.
- Notes are then moved to my Obsidian daily logs.
- Notes are either `Decisions` or `Questions`.
- Journal takes care of the To-Dos. (Same live meeting notes)
- For projects I use [Changelog as a consistent communication tool](https://hiran.in/notes/Changelog-as-a-consistent-communication-tool)
